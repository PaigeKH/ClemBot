# ClemBot
## About
A silly little Discord bot that links videos, adds reactions, and automates the assigning of roles for a friend's server.
## Usage
Create a .env file in the same directory as the bot.py file, and fill out the file with the API tokens/urls/etc. listed in the beginning of the bot.py file.
Procfile and requirements.txt files included so that it may be hosted.
